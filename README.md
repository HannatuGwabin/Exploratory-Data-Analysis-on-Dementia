## Resources
• Data Source: Kaggle

• Jupyter notebook

• Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn


## Overview
A neurological condition called Dementia impairs mental processes like memory, thought, and reasoning. It is a chronic ailment that can worsen with time, leaving the sufferer utterly dependent on others and severely impairing daily tasks. An early diagnosis can enhance people with dementia and their caregivers' quality of life.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial in comprehending and drawing conclusions from a dataset, especially when researching complicated phenomena like dementia. EDA enables researchers and analysts to find patterns, correlations, and hidden elements within the data, leading to a greater understanding of the condition. It does this by utilizing a variety of statistical and visualization tools. EDA can assist in revealing essential details about the demographic attributes, risk factors, progression patterns, and potential predictive factors connected to the disease when analyzing a dataset on dementia.


## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore every feature in the dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the data.


## Techniques used

✅ Import Libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn).

✅ Data Inspection (import Data, Descriptive Analysis, Data Shape, Data Info, and Check for missing Values).

✅ Data Cleaning (Used backwardfill to fill the missing values).

✅ EDA (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis).

## Summary of Insights

• There is a significant number of Demented people with 23.1% in Male while Female has 16.2%. But Studies have shown that Women have a greater risk of developing dementia during their lifetime. The main reason for this greater risk is because women live longer than men and old age is the biggest risk factor for this disease so this data could be as a result of other factors.

• Socioeconomic status has five levels and also has a way of affecting people with Dementia. A more significant number of people with 29.8% are on level 2 which is high SES status while 2.4% have Low SES. Low Socioeconomic status has been identified as a risk factor for the development of dementia.

• There is a wide distribution of about 40.2% of those that were visited once compared to 38.6% of people that were visited twice.

• The Mini Mental State Exam allows for a maximum score of 30. A score of 25 or higher is classed as normal. If the score is below 24, the result is usually considered to be abnormal, indicating possible cognitive impairment. We can see from our data that a more significant value have a score of 30 which is higher than 25 and considered normal while the others lower than 24 are considered abnormal..

• For Clinical  Dementia Rating:

52.2% have a CDR scale of 0, Which implies no Dementia.

33.0% have a CDR scale of 0.5, Which implies questionable Dementia.

11.0% have a CDR scale of 1, Which implies Moderate Dementia.

0.8% have a CDR scale of 2, Which implies Severe Dementia.

• There is a strong correlation between Visit and MR_Delay.


## Recommendations

• People living with Dementia should be visited more often as visits can be a way to support and comfort them.

• Improving socioeconomic status can positively impact various aspects of health, including reducing the risk of dementia. In addition, increased economic opportunities can improve income levels and financial security, positively impacting socioeconomic status.

• Improved healthcare access can lead to early detection and management of conditions that can increase the risk of dementia.
